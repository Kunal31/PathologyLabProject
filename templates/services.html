						A blood test is a laboratory analysis performed on a blood sample that is usually extracted from a vein in the arm using a needle, 
					    or via fingerprick. Multiple tests for specific blood components (such as a glucose test or a cholesterol test) are often grouped 
					    together into one test panel called a blood panel or blood work. Blood tests are often used in health care to determine 
					    physiological and biochemical states, such as disease, mineral content, pharmaceutical drug effectiveness, and organ function. 
					    Typical clinical blood panels include a basic metabolic panel or a complete blood count. 
					    Blood tests are also used in drug tests to detect drug abuse. 
					    In some of the United States a blood test is required before marriage historically this was true in more states.

					    A urinalysis (UA), also known as routine and microscopy is an array of tests performed on urine, 
					    and one of the most common methods of medical diagnosis. 
					    The word is a portmanteau of the words urine and analysis.
					    The target parameters that can be measured or quantified in urinalysis include many substances and cells, 
					    as well as other properties, such as specific gravity.
						A part of a urinalysis can be performed by using urine test strips, 
						in which the test results can be read as color changes. Another method is light microscopy of urine samples.

					    Saliva testing is a diagnostic technique that involves laboratory analysis of saliva to identify markers of 
					    endocrine, immunologic, inflammatory, infectious, and other types of conditions. 
					    Saliva is a useful biological fluid for assaying steroid hormones such as cortisol, genetic material like RNA, 
					    proteins such as enzymes and antibodies, and a variety of other substances, including natural metabolites, 
					    including saliva nitrite, a biomarker for nitric oxide status (see below for Cardiovascular Disease, Nitric Oxide: 
					    a salivary biomarker for cardio-protection). Saliva testing is used to screen for or diagnose numerous conditions 
					    and disease states, including Cushing's disease, anovulation, HIV, cancer, parasites, hypogonadism, and allergies.
